<em><strong> &#8220;So simple and so effective!&#8221;</strong></em><br />
<em><strong> &#8220;Clever advertising&#8230;.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>These were just a few of the comments left by industry professionals on a LinkedIn post when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/hp/update/6137882782434619392">someone shared a recent stunt undertaken by Revere London.</a></strong></p>
<p>For those who haven&#8217;t seen the campaign (or clicked on the above link), <a href="http://www.reverelondon.com/">Revere</a> is a coach builders, known for its premium marque after market upgrades. They are a luxury company, appealing to those with deep pockets and deeper bank accounts &#8211; this is not to say they&#8217;re exclusive, but they certainly appeal to someone of certain financial standing. In that vein, their customers are discerning and image conscious.</p>
<p>In an effort to raise broader public awareness (and presumably wider appeal/desire), Revere set about creating a publicity stunt, spray painting the exterior of a car to appear as though a disgruntled ex had taken their frustrations out with a can of red paint with words like &#8220;cheater&#8221; and &#8220;hope she was worth it&#8221; scrawled across the body panels&#8230;</p>
<p>For a period, the public believed this was an act of revenge by an ex, however when it came to light that this was indeed a publicity stunt and the industry commentary ensued, I wanted to do nothing more than introduce my head to the nearest wall&#8230;</p>
<p>One of my most referenced sections of any advertising book I&#8217;ve read comes from the inimitable Dave Trott. He writes that we should remove our personal views from creative ideas and appraisal, stating that <a href="http://davetrott.co.uk/2009/05/objective-good-subjective-bad/">we must remain &#8216;objective&#8217; and accept that &#8216;subjectivity&#8217; skews our perception</a>. So when others commented on this campaign with such bold remarks as &#8220;It Worked&#8221; or &#8220;Clever Advertising&#8221; I had to ask, &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8221; &#8211; the fact that I disliked it was an aside if someone could show me it actually delivered.</p>
<p>The focus for 99% of those who called it a success was that it reached the masses and gained critical coverage and drove conversation &#8211; and I can&#8217;t argue with that. The stunt did reach hundreds and thousands of people, papers picked up on it and people talked ad-nauseum about it (yes I realise I&#8217;m not helping matters with this post).</p>
<p>However, the single most prominent observation following all the chat and coverage, was that conversations were focussed on &#8220;that range rover&#8221;&#8230;<strong>Range Rover</strong>! The fundamental effort to raise awareness for Revere was lost on the masses as the image which struck them was a vandalised Range Rover, even after the reveal, Revere was not the heart of the brand association. So not only did they alienate their existing customers with a discrediting and crude stunt, they also drove awareness of the wrong product, most likely raising some eyebrows with the Range Rover brand team at the same time&#8230;and rightly so.</p>
<p>So where am I going with this? My point is this; in an industry so focussed on naval gazing and self appreciation, we seem to have lost sight of being critical of our efforts. We&#8217;ve become so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">subjective</span> that even when we&#8217;re considering results, we base them against our own expectations and perception, not those of the business or the man on the street &#8211; we make crude assumptions and grandiose remarks without justification or consideration. As is so often the case, a good percentage of those talking about the activity are marketing professionals and for that it will probably win awards in this self-congratulatory community &#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but will it win customers</span>?</p>
<p>Now, if Khan Designs want to get in touch to do something creative and effective&#8230;well, you know where we are!</p>
