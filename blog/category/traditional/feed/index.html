				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we all know by now, the creepy clowns of the world have taken to the streets. And they&#8217;re carrying knives. At night. It&#8217;s truly terrifying.</p>
<p>But the one good thing? They seem to have sent the world&#8217;s creepiest, redhead into hiding. Farewell, Ronald McDonald. Until we (hopefully never) meet again.</p>
<p>There is one big lesson to be learned from this: brands often forget to evaluate their messaging as a whole, and sometimes key parts of their identity (say, a killer clown) can somehow be carried through the times, simply because they&#8217;re not questioned.</p>

		<title>The Inevitable Decline of Vlogger Marketing</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2015/10/14/the-worlds-highest-paid-youtube-stars-2015/#62e0cecf542c">research piece unveiled by Forbes</a> in late 2015, it was revealed that the top 10 vloggers on YouTube earn anything between $2.5-$12 million in pre tax income each year. Topping that list is of course &#8211; my name sake &#8211; Felix Kjellberg aka. PewDiePie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Most of their earnings come from advertisements — both sponsored, integrated content and the pesky, inescapable previews&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Source: Forbes &#8217;15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rise from&#8230;essentially nothing, has seen vloggers being paid substantial sums by brands and in some cases (referring to Joe Sugg and Caspar Lee) have even seen TV shows created around them. All of this fame is driven solely by the hordes of followers who check-in to watch ever ounce of content they produce. It is these vast audiences which have seen marketers around the world try to find their &#8216;right to play&#8217; in the space and expose their products/brands to these waiting and wanting eyes.</p>
<p>The problem however, is that I foresee the vloggers have become victims of their own success and their audiences are increasingly savvy to marketing inclusions, however subtle or tertiary.</p>
<p>Rewind just a few years, (yes, before vloggers took hold) and the marketing world was rooted in traditional celebrity partnerships, often with little consideration to their appropriateness to a brand, but as a means to reach millions &#8216;by association&#8217;. These partnerships and endorsements would be a way for brands to push into new audiences, shift perceptions and refresh their offering. But sure enough, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinharrington/2014/01/31/save-your-money-celebrity-endorsements-not-worth-the-cost/#3b9ef35c57e5">it became evident</a> that these did not stand the test of time, just like so much marketing and advertising we still see today, it lacked authenticity and as such, it failed to build any belief amongst consumers. But above all else, it was simply too expensive to consider&#8230;</p>
<p>With this knowledge, I think we can all see where the world of &#8216;celebrity&#8217; vloggers is heading. Sure, their audiences will likely consume their content for as long as they produce it. They will continue to draw large sums from advertising both in video and on platform, from direct brand engagement and content network advertising. But &#8211; their proportional reliance on these revenue streams is surely going the way of the brand celebrity. Their audiences will remain disengaged with products and brands being slapped into their content and revenues will be increasingly driven by evolving contextual ad formats which deliver &#8216;real&#8217; value to the viewer. When a vlogger talks, their audiences only care about them, not who facilitated them, who&#8217;s given them something or who&#8217;s supporting an initiative&#8230;so marketers must learn to operate in the space around that content or be so intrinsic to it that it couldn&#8217;t otherwise exist!</p>
<p>Of course, there are caveats to all this.:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all vloggers are superstars, there are many passion focussed, accessible and authentic voices looking for great partnerships.</li>
<li>If a vlogger partnership is more than merely a fleeting collaboration, then products and brands will gain cut through over time, becoming synonymous to audiences &#8211; but this takes time&#8230;and the more time you take the more it costs&#8230;</li>
<li>Passions still remain key. Throwing tacks at a wall and seeing how many stick isn&#8217;t a saleable strategy, and that&#8217;s essentially the mass-audience approach of many brands simply hijacking audiences for a fee. Find a shared cause or passion and work together on something &#8211; authenticity is transparent, especially to an audience who know their blogger better than any brand ever will, they&#8217;ll see straight through it.</li>
<li>Brand partners. There are times when a meeting of minds is truly for a greater good. Their collaboration produces something which would otherwise be unachievable, un thought of and unprecedented &#8211; but to do this, you must relinquish control, invite all parties into the room and spend time creating something really special.</li>
</ol>
<p>As marketers and advertisers, we are operating in an ever crowded and confused space online; to audiences who are increasingly discerning and savvy to our cunning ways (were we ever really that cunning?!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But, this is a great thing!</strong></em></p>
<p>No longer can we be lazy, expectant and repetitive. We must evolve, adapt and create a two way communication channel, where any broadcast message or content enables someone to contribute or participate &#8211; we need to add real value through whatever channel we use, through authentic means to build belief. Only then, can we begin to expect anything from our consumers &#8211; they&#8217;re not as fickle as you might think &#8211; put them first, or come last!</p>

As part of its Emmy Awards sponsorship, the auto brand has collaborated with Airbnb to offer fans the opportunity to book a three-day getaway at the luxury Rondolino Residence in Death Valley, Nevada. The place is so isolated, it has no actual address &#8211; just coordinates on a map. With guests also getting to drive a 2017 Audi R8 during their stay, Audi tops it off with a fun, Super Bowl-esque ad entitled &#8216;Desolation&#8217;, which will run online and air during ABC&#8217;s Emmy telecast on Sunday. <em>Read more on <a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/audi-and-airbnb-offer-crazy-house-death-valley-and-great-ad-go-it-173541">Ad Freak</a>. </p>

This is some smart proof about how little things (in this case: two men legally changing their names to Elvis) can have a large positive impact on a brand.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United Colors of Benetton has been at the forefront of confrontational advertising for 20 years. They&#8217;ve addressed the the HIV epidemic, tackled animal abuse, examined the relationship between humans and nature and promoted dialogue about racial tension. Their 2011 &#8216;unHate&#8217; campaign tackled international political issues, with photoshopped images displaying <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1795496/benetton-courts-controversy-world-leader-lip-locks">Obama and Hugo Chavez locking lips</a>. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is a brand that has controversy pulsing through the fabric of their DNA. And their latest big ground-breaking controversial work? A series of relatable ads, with the tagline &#8220;clothes for humans&#8221;. &#8230; Because they&#8217;re Benetton, we&#8217;ve got to assume that there&#8217;s some deeper meaning behind these seemingly shallow  videos. So, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do. We will choose to assume that they&#8217;re being unconventional in their adoption of convention. We will choose to think that they&#8217;re subtly shutting down &#8220;conscious advertising&#8221;, and their fashionable adoption of feminism and equality. We will assume that these videos are a subtle jab at the vanity of a society, who search for &#8220;relatable&#8221; content, rather than looking outwards. Honestly, we&#8217;re pretty open to assuming anything right about now. But you, well, you can make up your own mind&#8230; </p>
