				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Facebook’s family of apps are moving in together. Facebook, Messenger and Instagram are each testing a feature that shows notification counters from the other apps and lets you instantly switch between them; ultimately designed to improve cross-platform user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feature is designed to boost engagement across the apps by using notification jewels to remind users there’s something to see in the other apps. This way if you miss or dismiss an alert when you first receive it, or you don’t get push notifications from every type of activity, you’ll still see that red number lingering in the corner, beckoning your attention.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Essentially, Facebook is leveraging the massive amounts of time consumers spend on their three largest platforms and are using functionality to continuously nudge users to engage with its other platforms &#8211; locking in user activity and hopefully generating more engagement.</span></p>

Now, the feature is available to all desktop users, meaning consumers who use it can see two videos at once in a news feed, opening up potentially new ad inventory.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">As more users, brands and publishers upload video to the platform, Facebook has actively developed more video products and is reportedly in talks with publishers and creators to make TV-quality original programs specifically for the platform, though </span><a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/5/19/15666906/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-original-video-tab-tv-delay"><span style="font-weight: 400">Re/code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> reports the time line for those efforts has been pushed back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Google is using billions of credit card transaction records to determine if its online ads are working, even if customers are purchasing items in brick-and-mortar stores, the company announced on Tuesday. Industry insiders described this as the ‘holy grail’ of online advertising, according to The Washington Post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the advance in technology allows Google to understand purchase activity and establishes the number of sales created by digital ad campaigns, it also renews privacy debates as to how the company is using customers&#8217; personal information. Google already analyzes user data through apps like Gmail, Google Maps and YouTube. But the new system will allow Google to connect that information with purchases made outside of the digital world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Google currently captures 70 percent of all credit and debit card transactions through unnamed partner firms, however, Google declined to comment on how the new system operates or what companies are sifting through these transaction records on Google&#8217;s behalf.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pinterest is adding another ad to its array of offerings, now allowing advertisers to publish video advertising that will automatically play in the home feed and search, as it continues to bulk up and woo advertisers with a different pitch from Facebook and Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pinterest has had to make the argument to advertisers that its 175 million users behave differently on Pinterest when compared to Facebook and Google, or even Twitter and Snapchat. Pinterest users come to the site and dig through products and recipes, among other things, for ideas. They then search deeper into topics, save them, and then eventually in theory acting on them later — either by cooking the dish or buying a product. Pinterest’s pitch is that unlike Facebook and Google, which can offer a compelling ad product for one point of that part of a customer’s buying life, it can offer products across its whole timeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ability to catch those possible customers early on and follow them all the way to the final buying process is something that might entice advertisers, but it still has to ensure it has the advertising products to back it up. Today’s announcement, which opens up autoplay video ads to all partners, gives it yet another argument that it can offer something competitive to Facebook — which has shown that video can have greater engagement and offers a potentially lucrative new source of customers. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The technology behind the three visual discovery tools Pinterest introduced in February — </span><a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/pinterest-lens-shop-the-look-instant-ideas/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lens, Shop the Look and Instant Ideas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> — is now being used to help advertisers optimize their Promoted Pins. Pinterest president Tim Kendall made the announcement at TechCrunch’s Disrupt NY 2017 event in New York Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>The social network said that in the same way the visual discovery technology is used on organic content, it recognizes characteristics within images—colors, shapes, textures—and determines which of those characteristics makes the pictured products unique.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Brands and advertisers will reap the benefits of the addition of visual discovery technology without having to do anything, Pinterest said. Pinterest added that ads using visual discovery technology will begin to appear in Related Pins and Instant Ideas immediately, with Shop the Look and Lens to follow, but the social network did not offer details on timing for the latter.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Facebook is making good on Mark Zuckerberg’s </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634"><span style="font-weight: 400">promise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to build a community by improving admin tools for Facebook Groups. Now Group admins can establish up to three questions for people requesting to join their Group to answer. This lets admins screen potential members to ensure they’re the right fit for the group and will add constructively to the discussion, not just spam or troll the Group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a Facebook spokesperson stated:</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> “ Establishing open-ended questions enables group admins to more quickly review and approve member requests; in turn, people seeking communities of support or shared interest can more quickly connect with others.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This second consecutive security update to protect its users &#8211; and the communities they form on the platform &#8211; illustrates how seriously Facebook have taken the threats posed by trolls and people looking to disrupt users enjoyment of the service. The broader motivator behind both of these developments is that Facebook want to ensure its active user base are not disincentivized from spending time on the channel.</span></p>
