				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine creating a masterpiece out of polluted air. Ridiculous, right?</p>
<p>Not for Tiger Beer. Working alongside Marcel Sydney and MIT spinoff Graviky Labs, they&#8217;ve developed a paint that is made entirely of air pollution from vehicles across Asia.</p>
<p>The brand created 150 litres of Tiger Air-Ink in pens, markers and spray cans so that different types of artists could experiment with it, before taking the product to up-and-coming street artists in Asia, a region facing major pollution concerns, asking them to work their magic with the spray paint and pens.</p>
<p>Although it may not be the first innovative use of exhaust, this technology can now be adapted for larger vehicles and vessels to capture even more pollution and clean up the air, one pen and painting at a time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A jolly fellow that champions our favourite festive season, edgier than Santa Claus and more delicious than Christmas dinner&#8230;</p>
<p>Enter the legend of Carl the Great Bratsgiver.</p>
<p>Dreamt up by the employees at Johnsonville and brought to life by Droga5, Carl spreads joy across the globe on National Bratwurst Day (August 16 if you didn&#8217;t already know) by bringing delicious products to brat lovers everywhere.</p>
<p>Why? &#8220;Every year we want it to feel more and more like a real holiday. When you see Carl the Great Bratsgiver out, it becomes a little more real, just as Santa Claus becomes a little more real every time you see him out at the mall,&#8221;  said Scott Bell, Group Creative Director at Droga5.</p>
<p>Go Carl.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A campaign to buy the entire ad inventory of a London Underground station and fill it with pictures of cats has signed a contract with Exterion Media to bring the project to life.</p>
<div id="hero">
<figure>The Citizens Advertising Takeover Service was launched in April by Glimpse, and will have a two-week stint at Clapham Common station from 12 September 2016, taking over all poster sites in the entrance hall, escalators and tunnels, though not those on platforms.</figure>
</div>
<p class="p2">Two charities that will feature their feline friends will be Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home and Cats Protection, after Glimpse agreed a partnership.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the aim of this feline frenzy? Interestingly, according to Glimpse Founder James Turner, it&#8217;s to encourage people to think actively about how advertising affects them, and how the power of creativity can &#8220;help change minds and encourage positive values in society.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watch out, wine snobs. Millennials are officially out-guzzling baby boomers when it comes to wine consumption &#8211; 36 percent of wine drinkers in the U.S. are millennials versus 34 percent of baby boomers, according to the Wine Market Council. So how are some brands appealing to this new target audience? They&#8217;re busy crafting innovative packaging, clever labels and approachable messaging, all with the aim of breaking down the barriers of entry to drinking wine. Observe below: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ManCan</strong> The can that makes drinking wine easier by the poolside, at a game or picnics, accompanied by the tagline &#8211; &#8220;Shut up and drink.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Underwood</strong> Another wine-in-a-can brand that produces videos poking fun at wine snobs, its tagline is &#8211; &#8220;Wine doesn&#8217;t have to be this hard.   Pinkies down.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Rebel Coast Winery</strong> Traditional glass bottles that have stand-out names like Sunday Funday and Reckless Love, with slogans such as &#8220;Pairs well with ignoring your parents&#8217; advice.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>The Drop</strong> Rosé in a can—or, as it&#8217;s sometimes called, &#8220;brosé.&#8221;</li>
