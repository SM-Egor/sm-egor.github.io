				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brexit. I&#8217;ve remained fairly silent in the aftermath of what will likely be (and is indeed already becoming) a fundamental change in the UK&#8217;s position both economically and politically on the global stage. But this is not a rant on the outcome, nor a insight into the failed debates which existed from both sides. No, this is my rant about something much bigger, something which was highlighted during the leave/remain campaign, but was merely symptomatic of the scenario.</p>
<p>As we have found ourselves ever increasingly using our social estates as news sources, and relying on our peers to be our primary filters, we are also increasingly narrowed in our visibility of the wider debate. This extends far beyond Brexit, this extends to global events at every level. As we become more self aware and ever more self conscious, more concerned for the image we portray to the world than the images the world has to share with us, we ultimately spend more time on those social channels surrounded by the &#8216;news&#8217; curated for us.</p>
<p>This distilled view is the problem.</p>
<p>By finding ourselves immersed in this &#8220;social news&#8221; system, we have immediately narrowed our perspectives to those shared by our connections, with whom we are linked because of our inherent similarities and often views. This systemic approach ultimately means we are lured into a dangerous scenario whereby we each have our beliefs reinforced and become further detached from others&#8217; points of view, seeing them as a minority who are clearly miss-informed.</p>
<p>This was never more evident to me than in the lead up to Brexit, where based on my Facebook feed, news sharing and curated media, the outcome could only be that we would remain. It was only by wanting to examine the flip-side that I was exposed the opposing campaign and media, something which had I not taken action to do, would have been nigh-on invisible.</p>
<p>With social media, we have been able to &#8216;connect&#8217; with more people, but in doing so, we have actually narrowed our &#8216;global&#8217; view, we have created an ever widening divide between people where thoughts, opinions and views differ. As individuals we are only partly to blame, Facebook has (with it&#8217;s clever little algorithm) thrown fuel on the fire by prioritising content from those with whom we engage with most, and by logical deduction, those with whom we share most in common&#8230;</p>
<p>I realise using Facebook as our news source is a failing and a terrible way to perceive the world. But as a younger generation grow up in a world where their connections and content are key, I fear the desire to look beyond these familiar and trusted &#8216;comfort zones&#8217; will only decline. For them, I believe this distilled &#8216;news&#8217; will become the norm, separation will grow, cultural divides will increase and the playground cliques we grew out of will become the real life worlds in which we one day find ourselves; blissfully ignorant to the reality, so long as our beliefs are reinforced by our closest peers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Currently my Facebook feed would suggest that there is categorically no way Trump will be president&#8230;I guess we&#8217;ll have to wait and see&#8230;</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2015/10/14/the-worlds-highest-paid-youtube-stars-2015/#62e0cecf542c">research piece unveiled by Forbes</a> in late 2015, it was revealed that the top 10 vloggers on YouTube earn anything between $2.5-$12 million in pre tax income each year. Topping that list is of course &#8211; my name sake &#8211; Felix Kjellberg aka. PewDiePie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Most of their earnings come from advertisements — both sponsored, integrated content and the pesky, inescapable previews&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Source: Forbes &#8217;15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rise from&#8230;essentially nothing, has seen vloggers being paid substantial sums by brands and in some cases (referring to Joe Sugg and Caspar Lee) have even seen TV shows created around them. All of this fame is driven solely by the hordes of followers who check-in to watch ever ounce of content they produce. It is these vast audiences which have seen marketers around the world try to find their &#8216;right to play&#8217; in the space and expose their products/brands to these waiting and wanting eyes.</p>
<p>The problem however, is that I foresee the vloggers have become victims of their own success and their audiences are increasingly savvy to marketing inclusions, however subtle or tertiary.</p>
<p>Rewind just a few years, (yes, before vloggers took hold) and the marketing world was rooted in traditional celebrity partnerships, often with little consideration to their appropriateness to a brand, but as a means to reach millions &#8216;by association&#8217;. These partnerships and endorsements would be a way for brands to push into new audiences, shift perceptions and refresh their offering. But sure enough, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinharrington/2014/01/31/save-your-money-celebrity-endorsements-not-worth-the-cost/#3b9ef35c57e5">it became evident</a> that these did not stand the test of time, just like so much marketing and advertising we still see today, it lacked authenticity and as such, it failed to build any belief amongst consumers. But above all else, it was simply too expensive to consider&#8230;</p>
<p>With this knowledge, I think we can all see where the world of &#8216;celebrity&#8217; vloggers is heading. Sure, their audiences will likely consume their content for as long as they produce it. They will continue to draw large sums from advertising both in video and on platform, from direct brand engagement and content network advertising. But &#8211; their proportional reliance on these revenue streams is surely going the way of the brand celebrity. Their audiences will remain disengaged with products and brands being slapped into their content and revenues will be increasingly driven by evolving contextual ad formats which deliver &#8216;real&#8217; value to the viewer. When a vlogger talks, their audiences only care about them, not who facilitated them, who&#8217;s given them something or who&#8217;s supporting an initiative&#8230;so marketers must learn to operate in the space around that content or be so intrinsic to it that it couldn&#8217;t otherwise exist!</p>
<p>Of course, there are caveats to all this.:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all vloggers are superstars, there are many passion focussed, accessible and authentic voices looking for great partnerships.</li>
<li>If a vlogger partnership is more than merely a fleeting collaboration, then products and brands will gain cut through over time, becoming synonymous to audiences &#8211; but this takes time&#8230;and the more time you take the more it costs&#8230;</li>
<li>Passions still remain key. Throwing tacks at a wall and seeing how many stick isn&#8217;t a saleable strategy, and that&#8217;s essentially the mass-audience approach of many brands simply hijacking audiences for a fee. Find a shared cause or passion and work together on something &#8211; authenticity is transparent, especially to an audience who know their blogger better than any brand ever will, they&#8217;ll see straight through it.</li>
<li>Brand partners. There are times when a meeting of minds is truly for a greater good. Their collaboration produces something which would otherwise be unachievable, un thought of and unprecedented &#8211; but to do this, you must relinquish control, invite all parties into the room and spend time creating something really special.</li>
</ol>
<p>As marketers and advertisers, we are operating in an ever crowded and confused space online; to audiences who are increasingly discerning and savvy to our cunning ways (were we ever really that cunning?!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>But, this is a great thing!</strong></em></p>
<p>No longer can we be lazy, expectant and repetitive. We must evolve, adapt and create a two way communication channel, where any broadcast message or content enables someone to contribute or participate &#8211; we need to add real value through whatever channel we use, through authentic means to build belief. Only then, can we begin to expect anything from our consumers &#8211; they&#8217;re not as fickle as you might think &#8211; put them first, or come last!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Have you heard? There&#8217;s a new Top Gear!</strong></p>
<p>After what seems like a rollercoaster of decisions, rulings and debate, the new series of Top Gear took to our screens this bank holiday weekend to a flurry of <del>critical acclaim</del> criticism from a majority of viewers &#8211; and media. Most were focussed on the specific individuals now presenting the show, with a rift of opinion dividing Mat LeBlanc (I must stop calling him Joey) and Chris Evans, with most favouring the former.</p>
<p>I however remained &#8211; unusually &#8211; more impartial on the situation, claiming the show simply lacked lustre and engagement, failing to capture my attention on a show which I would have previously planned an evening around.</p>
<p>This post however is less about my thoughts on the broadcast itself, but rather the effects of a simple tweet&#8230;my tweet.</p>
<p>Having watched a small portion of the show, I could take it no more (for reasons I won&#8217;t air here) and with it I posted a simple tweet. In all honesty it isn;t even that funny or witty compared to many other which followed it, but the ensuing success proves that even above great content, timing is everything.</p>
<p>This was the tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Not to worry, I&#8217;ve turned off <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TopGear?src=hash">#TopGear</a> and found this much more stimulating activity&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/nYKygHtKOE">pic.twitter.com/nYKygHtKOE</a></p>
<p>— Felix Hemsley (@FelixHemsley) <a href="https://twitter.com/FelixHemsley/status/737004365219762177">May 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As you&#8217;ll see, this was just over half way through the show. Conversation was heating up as people began to accept the reality of what they were seeing. Thankfully, this was one of the earliest posts to use a visual reference to how I felt, others simply posting disgruntled text based tweets. So combine a lucky bit of timing with some visual content and voila, success. As I started to see the numbers rise I was please, but then a realisation that this was gaining true traction set in, but for what&#8230;? I have since seen so many posts which have had me laughing out loud, capturing the true emotions and culture of the web much better than I had, but they missed the boat, especially when it comes to online publications picking up on these things to post reactive articles, which is what followed.</p>
<p>Friends started texting and Whatsapping(?) me about how I&#8217;d been picked up at first by the Lad Bible who frames this as &#8220;How Twitter Reacted To The New &#8216;Top Gear'&#8221; and then later by The Telegraph, including this as one of the &#8220;23 Funniest Tweets&#8221; and again since. An so it continues, even 3 days later via IMGUR, with time ton search for much better material, it is still that content which was published quickly and with moderate quality which has captured the eyes of many &#8211; or maybe I&#8217;m just more humorous than I realise&#8230;unlikely.</p>
<p>I realise this works because I am a person, not a brand, but brands who do play reactively have managed to gain the mandate to be playful like consumers because they share values and the tone at the right time, as part of the conversation. So maybe, rather than debate by committee on every topic, we should be more free in how we &#8216;play&#8217; &#8211; at best we get shared with thousands and showcased, at worst, we get forgotten about by never being seen.</p>
<p>Whatever your approach to timely communications and alignment to live events, being first is as critical as it ever was in a publishing house, as everyone on Twitter is now one of those publishers, vying for the same eyes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;It Worked.&#8221;</strong></em><br />
<em><strong> &#8220;So simple and so effective!&#8221;</strong></em><br />
<em><strong> &#8220;Clever advertising&#8230;.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>These were just a few of the comments left by industry professionals on a LinkedIn post when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/hp/update/6137882782434619392">someone shared a recent stunt undertaken by Revere London.</a></strong></p>
<p>For those who haven&#8217;t seen the campaign (or clicked on the above link), <a href="http://www.reverelondon.com/">Revere</a> is a coach builders, known for its premium marque after market upgrades. They are a luxury company, appealing to those with deep pockets and deeper bank accounts &#8211; this is not to say they&#8217;re exclusive, but they certainly appeal to someone of certain financial standing. In that vein, their customers are discerning and image conscious.</p>
<p>In an effort to raise broader public awareness (and presumably wider appeal/desire), Revere set about creating a publicity stunt, spray painting the exterior of a car to appear as though a disgruntled ex had taken their frustrations out with a can of red paint with words like &#8220;cheater&#8221; and &#8220;hope she was worth it&#8221; scrawled across the body panels&#8230;</p>
<p>For a period, the public believed this was an act of revenge by an ex, however when it came to light that this was indeed a publicity stunt and the industry commentary ensued, I wanted to do nothing more than introduce my head to the nearest wall&#8230;</p>
<p>One of my most referenced sections of any advertising book I&#8217;ve read comes from the inimitable Dave Trott. He writes that we should remove our personal views from creative ideas and appraisal, stating that <a href="http://davetrott.co.uk/2009/05/objective-good-subjective-bad/">we must remain &#8216;objective&#8217; and accept that &#8216;subjectivity&#8217; skews our perception</a>. So when others commented on this campaign with such bold remarks as &#8220;It Worked&#8221; or &#8220;Clever Advertising&#8221; I had to ask, &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8221; &#8211; the fact that I disliked it was an aside if someone could show me it actually delivered.</p>
<p>The focus for 99% of those who called it a success was that it reached the masses and gained critical coverage and drove conversation &#8211; and I can&#8217;t argue with that. The stunt did reach hundreds and thousands of people, papers picked up on it and people talked ad-nauseum about it (yes I realise I&#8217;m not helping matters with this post).</p>
<p>However, the single most prominent observation following all the chat and coverage, was that conversations were focussed on &#8220;that range rover&#8221;&#8230;<strong>Range Rover</strong>! The fundamental effort to raise awareness for Revere was lost on the masses as the image which struck them was a vandalised Range Rover, even after the reveal, Revere was not the heart of the brand association. So not only did they alienate their existing customers with a discrediting and crude stunt, they also drove awareness of the wrong product, most likely raising some eyebrows with the Range Rover brand team at the same time&#8230;and rightly so.</p>
<p>So where am I going with this? My point is this; in an industry so focussed on naval gazing and self appreciation, we seem to have lost sight of being critical of our efforts. We&#8217;ve become so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">subjective</span> that even when we&#8217;re considering results, we base them against our own expectations and perception, not those of the business or the man on the street &#8211; we make crude assumptions and grandiose remarks without justification or consideration. As is so often the case, a good percentage of those talking about the activity are marketing professionals and for that it will probably win awards in this self-congratulatory community &#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but will it win customers</span>?</p>
<p>Now, if Khan Designs want to get in touch to do something creative and effective&#8230;well, you know where we are!</p>

But not Jen from Skyscanner. She taught us that with a little creativity, and a lot of tongue in cheek &#8211; you can turn those scary queries into community management gold. </p>
