				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The challenge for professional photographers to capture stand-out photography at the Olympic games is more real than ever when <em>everyone</em> &#8211; from Olympic athletes to the millions of fans &#8211; is making the memories themselves.</p>
<p>Enter Getty Images. To keep one step ahead of the smartphone masses, they&#8217;re using new technology to capture angles and views that no phone can compete with.</p>
<p>Think underwater cameras for swimming, overhead robot cameras to capture gymnastics and other stadium sports, and 360-degree cameras to create immersive photography that works on VR headsets like the Gear 360.</p>
<p>The result? A unique twist on flips from the likes of Simone Biles and a different view on how Michael Phelps dominates in the pool. Take that, smartphone.</p>

It may be their plaid-wearing, bearded-yet-somehow-still-not-hipster public bosses, or it could be their punk-yet-nice products. Or it could be some very smart marketing. Who&#8217;s to say? Either way, they&#8217;ve just managed to enter into a legal battle where they&#8217;re 90% in the wrong, and emerge looking like the world&#8217;s nicest guys. This is some smart proof about how little things (in this case: two men legally changing their names to Elvis) can have a large positive impact on a brand. You know what they say &#8211; live the brand. It could end up getting you some great free PR, and a swell new name too. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Snapchat has officially released Spectacles,  its highly anticipated &#8220;toy&#8221;, so named by Evan Speigel, CEO of renamed Snap Inc. What is Spectacles, you may ask? The product is exactly what the name would suggest. But, when you slip them on and tap a button near the hinge, it records up to 10 seconds of video from your first-person vantage. Each new tap records another clip, and it&#8217;s connected wirelessly to your smartphone, making it easily shareable. Why use a pair of video sunglasses—available this fall, by the way, one-size-fits-all in black, teal or coral—instead of holding up your smartphone like everyone else? Because, Spiegel says, the images that result are fundamentally different. Spectacles’ camera uses a 115-degree-angle lens, wider than a typical smartphone’s and much closer to the eyes’ natural field of view. The video it records is circular, more like human vision. (Spiegel argues that rectangles are an unnecessary vestige of printing photos on sheets of paper.) As you record, your hands are free to pet dogs, hug babies or flail around at a concert. You can reach your arms out to people you’re filming, instead of holding your phone up, as Spiegel describes it, “like a wall in front of your face.” With the risks that have inherently come with this kind of tech release, you might wonder, why now? In the words of Speigel &#8211; &#8220;because it&#8217;s fun.&#8221; And because it echoes Google Glass, but with a sense of purpose, it could be a lot of very successful fun, for people and brands alike. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-releases-first-hardware-product-spectacles-1474682719"><em>Read more on WSJ.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They say you’re never more than three feet from a rat in London. But what about a faceless woman, or the remains of a burnt witch? London’s spine-chilling history is being brought to life this Halloween… We live in a city rich with history &#8211; some of it disturbingly creepy. Its past is well recorded, but the ghosts, ghouls, and ghastly bits have never been brought together online; until now. With Halloween just a few days away, we felt it was time fellow Londoners knew a little more about what lurks in the shadows of the Big Smoke we call home. Enter Grim London. Perhaps you’re living on top of a plague pit, or next door to a baby farmer’s house. Bringing the scary truths to life, Grim London is a personalised interactive map of the most spine-chilling events that have occurred across the capital. </p>
